### Description

This App allows you to write, publish, delete and edit a list of messages online.

It was built using React, React-Router and Redux. Non-functional requirements e.g. security, unit-tests and performance have been ignored. The design and styling is with Bootstrap 4 with font-awesome for the icons. The app has been pre-loaded with a dummy list of messages.
